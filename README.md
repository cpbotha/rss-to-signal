# rss-to-signal

notify signal groups and users of new RSS posts

Use from cron to monitor any number of different feeds (distinguished by the `feed_name` argument) and send post notifications to any number of Signal groups, usernames and telephone numbers using [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli).

This script was made by and for [the cpbotha.net WHV blog](https://cpbotha.net/following-this-blog/#subscribe-via-signal). It was pushed to github for the first time on 2025-06-21 and is probably still full of bugs.
